# 2&emsp;Install Ubuntu and ROS2
Install Ubuntu 24.04 and ROS2 Jazzy based on the following guides. 

Ubuntu 24.04 can be installed on VirtualBox (virtualization) or dual boot are supported. 
If your computer has warranty and you have backed up your data, dual booting is strongly recommended.
Doing so allows you to learn about the process and the steps to solve any errors that occur.
Otherwise, VirtualBox can be used.

The guide to setup a GitHub repository can be ignored.

# 3&emsp;Setup Project

1. In Ubuntu, open a terminal with `Ctrl+Alt+T`.

2. On the terminal, install the following packages
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt install ros-jazzy-turtlebot3-gazebo ros-jazzy-turtlebot3-teleop ros-jazzy-turtlebot3-cartographer ros-jazzy-nav2-map-server ros-jazzy-turtlebot3-navigation2 ros-jazzy-nav2-route -y
    ```

3. Clone the GitHub repository:

    ```bash
    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/LaiYanKai/ee3305
    ```

4. There should now be a folder called `ee3305` in the home directory. Avoid renaming it or any files below to `me3243` as doing so may break the development process. Let this `ee3305` directory be the **workspace** directory.

5. Navigate into the workspace folder and build the workspace.

    ```bash
    cd ~/ee3305
    colcon build --symlink-install
    ```

    Wait for about a minute.

# 4&emsp;Tasks

1. Form teams of three.

2. Complete all the tasks in the markdown documents as a team.

3. Sign up for the presentation slots on Canvas &rarr; People &rarr; P2P.

4. Submit all submittables to Canvas before the deadline.
